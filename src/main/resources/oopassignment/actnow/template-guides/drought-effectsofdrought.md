# Effects of Drought
Drought

## Water
Reduced river and stream flows can raise water pollution levels and induce stagnation. Lower oxygen levels are caused by warmer lake and reservoir water. Fish, other aquatic life, and water quality may be impacted at these levels. Wildfires brought on by a drought can cause runoff to contain more silt, ash, charcoal, and woody debris that can endanger fish and other aquatic life by lowering oxygen levels in the water. Over time, groundwater resources are not restored at a usual pace due to decreased precipitation and increasing surface water evaporation.

## Hunger and Famine
When there is a drought, either via natural precipitation or irrigation utilizing reserve water supplies, there is frequently not enough water available to maintain food crops. Grain and grass used to feed cattle and fowl are also impacted by this issue. People go without food when food supplies are threatened or destroyed by drought. Famine might happen in the event of a severe drought that lasts for a long time. Many of us are familiar with the Ethiopian famine of 1984, which was brought on by a lethal confluence of a severe drought and a government that was dangerously inept. It resulted in hundreds of thousands of deaths.

## Recreational Risk
When there is a drought, those who participate in water-related recreational activities may be more likely to contract a waterborne illness brought on by bacteria, protozoa, and other pollutants including chemicals and heavy metals. Accidental or purposeful ingestion of water, direct contact with pollutants on mucosal membranes, or inhalation of contaminants are all ways that people might become exposed. In times of drought, untreated surface water might pose a health risk. Some infections, such as a particular amoeba are more prevalent in untreated surface waters during droughts because low water levels may result in higher water temperatures that favor their growth. Injury risk rises as surface water levels in areas utilized for fishing, boating, and swimming decline. Low water levels in lakes can put individuals at risk for fatal accidents from diving into dangerously shallow water or running into hidden items while boating. Additionally, low surface water levels can reveal potentially harmful material from lakes, rivers, and ponds' bottoms.

## Air Quality
Drought typically comes with dusty, dry weather, and wildfires that may be harmful to health. Pollen, smoke, and fluorocarbons are just a few of the particles that are suspended in the air due to fire, dry soil, and vegetation. These compounds have the potential to aggravate lung and bronchial irritation, aggravating chronic respiratory conditions including asthma. Acute respiratory infections like bronchitis and bacterial pneumonia may also become more common as a result. Other drought-related issues, such as the prevalence of airborne toxins from freshwater cyanobacterial blooms, have an impact on air quality. These pollutants have been linked to lung irritation and are airborne. In some populations, this can have detrimental health implications.

## Hygiene
Many illnesses are lowered or controlled by having access to water for hygiene, sanitation, and cleaning. Although water conservation is necessary due to the current drought, it shouldn't stand in the way of good sanitation and hygiene. There are water-saving techniques for doing personal hygiene, cleaning, hand washing, and washing fruits and vegetables. One way to cut water usage and keep up hand washing and other healthy hygiene practices is by installing low-flow faucet aerators in homes and offices.

## Wars
People will compete and eventually fight and kill to get enough water to survive when a valuable resource like water is in low supply owing to a drought and the shortage of water results in a corresponding scarcity of food. Some people think that the present Syrian civil war began when 1.5 million rural Syrians moved to the metropolis from their drought-stricken rural districts, causing instability.

## Infectious Disease
Drought can directly result in an increase in infectious diseases.
When rainfall declines, viruses, protozoa, and bacteria can contaminate both groundwater and surface water. Private well users may be more susceptible to infectious diseases associated with the drought. People with underlying chronic diseases are among other populations who are also more at risk. When hand washing is hampered by a perceived or actual scarcity of water, acute respiratory and gastrointestinal infections are more likely to be transmitted from one person to another. When there is a lack of water, the chance of contracting an infectious disease rises.
