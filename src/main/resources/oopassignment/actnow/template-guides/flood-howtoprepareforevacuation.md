# How to prepare for evacuation before a flood
Flood

## 1.	Bring your most important stuff

Every document that you deem as useful should be the first thing that you take before evacuating from your house such as the original copy of your birth certificate, insurance paper and family registration.

## 2.	Make a soft copy of your files

If youâ€™re not able to bring your electrical devices, you are able to save your files into the cloud so that you can still access them.

## 3.	Turning off the electricity

The worst thing that a flood can do to your house is that the house is flooded when the electricity is still flowing. To combat this problem, you can turn off your electricity flow to your house before leaving the house for evacuation.

## 4.	Cover the holes in your house with sandbags

You can cover your doors with sandbags so that the water is not able to come in and do damage to your house. You can also close your windows tightly and also put some wooden boards on top of the window so that the water will not easily get in.

## 5.	Check your drainage system

If you have a basement, you need to check if your drainage system is working properly and not clogged because the basement is the first place that will be filled with water during the flood.
