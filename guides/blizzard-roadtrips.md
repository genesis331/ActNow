# Road Trips
Blizzard

Make sure you have fully stocked safety kit before you head out. Muccilli said the kit should include:
- A survival blanket
- Road salt and a shovel
- A scraper
- Jumper cables
- Drinking water
- A repair kit
- A flashlight and road flares
- A cell phone charger

You should also fill your wiper fluid and check your tire pressure, tire tread and oil before leaving. Make sure your phone is fully charged.

"If the weather becomes too severe to continue driving, pull over, and if possible move your car to the closest gas station or hotel and ride out the storm," Muccilli said. Don't drive around barriers onto closed-off roads.

What if your car is stuck in the snow?
If conditions are safe enough, you can "attempt to shovel out your tires and throw down sand, rock salt, dirt, cardboard or kitty litter to give your vehicle more traction. If this does not work, call for roadside assistance or emergency services."
Otherwise, Muccilli said stay inside your vehicle except long enough to set road flares or put out a colorful cloth to make yourself visible. Contact emergency services with as much information about your situation as you can. 
The NWS advises not to leave your vehicle to walk for help during a blizzard. You could get disoriented. You should run the motor about 10 minutes each hour for heat, it says, but open the window a crack for fresh air. Clear snow away from the exhaust pipe if possible.
