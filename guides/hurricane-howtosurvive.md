# How to Survive

If you didn't manage to evacuate, follow these guidelines: 
- Stay indoors and away from windows and glass doors.
- Close all interior doors, and secure and brace external doors.
- Keep curtains and blinds closed. Don't be fooled if there is a lull; It could be the eye of the storm.
- Take refuge in a small interior room, closet, or hallway on the lowest level.
- Lie on the floor under a table or another sturdy object.
