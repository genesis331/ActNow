# Protect Your Family

- Talk with your family about what to do if a winter storm watch or warning is issued. 
- Have your vehicle winterized before the winter storm season to decrease your chance of being stranded.
    - Have a mechanic check your battery, antifreeze, wipers and windshield washer fluid, ignition system, thermostat, lights, flashing hazard lights, exhaust system, heater, brakes, defroster, and oil.
    - Install good winter tires with adequate tread. All-weather radials are usually adequate but some jurisdictions require vehicles to be equipped with chains or snow tires with studs.
- Keep in your vehicle: 
    - A windshield scraper and small broom 
    - A small sack of sand for generating traction under wheels and a set of tire chains or traction mats 
    - Matches in a waterproof container 
    - A brightly colored (preferably red) cloth to tie to the antenna 
    - An emergency supply kit, including warm clothing
- Keep your vehicleâ€™s gas tank full so you can leave right away in an emergency and to keep the fuel line from freezing.
- Keep a supply of non-clumping kitty litter to make walkways and steps less slippery.
- Service snow removal equipment before the winter storm season and maintain it in good working order.
- Keep handy a warm coat, gloves or mittens, hat, water-resistant boots, and extra blankets and warm clothing for everyone in your household.
