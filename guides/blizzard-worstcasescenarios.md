# Worst-case scenarios
Blizzard

- Try to find shelter: Also, attempt to stay dry and cover all of your body.
    - Can't find shelter? See if you can make a lean-to, windbreak or snow cave for protection from the wind. Try to set a fire. If there are rocks nearby, put those around the fire to retain heat. Global Rescue says even low-hanging tree branches could provide some protection.
- Out of water? You should melt snow for drinking water. The NWS and Global Rescue warn that eating unmelted snow will lower your body temperature.
- Strategic exercise: From time to time, move your arms, legs, fingers and toes to keep your blood pumping and stay warm. But don't overdo it. "The strain from the cold and the hard labor may cause a heart attack. Sweating could lead to a chill and hypothermia," the NWS website says.
