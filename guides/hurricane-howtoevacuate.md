# How to Evacuate
Hurricane

If there's a hurricane in your area, you should evacuate under the following conditions: 

- If you are directed by local authorities to do so, do so immediately and be sure to follow their instructions.
- If you live in a mobile home or temporary structure, leave it immediately. Such shelters are particularly hazardous during hurricanes no matter how well fastened to the ground.
- If you live in a high-rise building, get to the lowest possible level as soon as possible. Avoid using the lift and use the emergency stairs. Hurricane winds are stronger at higher elevations.
- If you live on the coast, on a floodplain, near a river, or on an inland waterways, get out of those areas as they can be dangerous during hurricanes.
- If you feel that you are in danger, just run for your life.
