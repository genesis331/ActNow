# How to evacuate during a flood

## 1.	Go to a higher place

If you’re stuck in a flood, you need to search for a higher place such as a second floor to a home or even mountains if you have enough time to go to it.

## 2.	Keep your pets safe with you

Most pets can not survive in a flood, so you need to bring your pet with you to save them.

## 3.	Always be cautious

There will be a lot of water on the streets that might bring debris and mud so you need to watch where you are stepping at because there are a lot of sharp objects. You also need to dodge any power line that might still have electricity flowing because you might get electrocuted.

## 4.	Search for a place to evacuate

If you don’t have any higher places near you, schools or police stations might be your best chance to get some help and to keep safe in a flood.
