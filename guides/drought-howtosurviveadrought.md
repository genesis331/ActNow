# How to survive a drought

Drought is defined as a lengthy period of exceptionally low rainfall, resulting in a water scarcity. 

To survive a drought, you should have a rainwater collection system by installing a water collecting structure on your roof is the most secure technique to mitigate the consequences of a drought. It's never been easier to get it installed, as hundreds of organizations around the country have sprung up to provide large water tanks and the administrations essential to get them installed. A water catchment framework works by collecting rainwater on your roof and storing it in large water tanks, which can subsequently be used when your electricity goes out and your taps run dry.

Another way is before the drought, you should begin storing large amounts of water. Storing water is a simple process that, if done correctly, may be stored for an indefinite period of time. There are examples of elderly couples storing drinking water for a long period with no negative consequences. Specific water holders may be purchased at almost any handyman store and stored safely in your home. However, keep in mind that if the compartment fails for unknown reasons, you may experience a little surge in your house.

### Tips for Saving Water Indoors During a Drought
- Don't flush the toilet more often than necessary. Use the garbage instead of the toilet to dispose of tissues, insects, and other similar debris.
- Take quick showers as opposed to baths. Only use the water once to become wet, soap up, and then rinse off.
- When shaving, cleaning your face, or brushing your teeth, don't let the water run.
- Dishwashers that run automatically should only be used when completely filled. To use less water, choose the "light wash" option.
- Pour two containers—one with soapy water and the other with rinse water with a tiny bit of chlorine bleach—into which you will be hand-washing the dishes.
- Instead of running water from the tap, wash veggies in a pan of water.
- Save water by not waiting for it to warm up. You may store it for later applications, such watering plants, or you can warm it up on the stove or in the microwave.
- Before putting dishes in the dishwasher, merely remove any big food particles without rinsing them.
- Never defrost meat or other frozen goods under running water. Use the defrost setting on your microwave or leave food in the refrigerator overnight to thaw.
