# What to Do If You Are Trapped During a Wildfire
Wildfire

In the event that an evacuation is not issued but there are heavy smoke conditions, stay inside or seek a safer location. If for some reason, you do not leave your area and the fire has trapped you in your home or school building, do the following:

- Call emergency hotline (999 in Malaysia). Quickly provide them with your location and situation.
- Turn on all the lights. This allows firefighters to identify your building easier in smoky conditions.
- Close all doors, windows, vents and fire screens. Be sure to keep the doors unlocked. This allows firefighters to enter easily.
- Move all curtains away from the windows and sliding glass doors. Curtains are highly flammable. Removing them reduces fuel for the fire.
- Fill your sinks and tubs with cold water.
- Stay inside and away from outer walls and windows.

If you become trapped in your vehicle during a wildfire, certain measures should be taken. These include:

- Call emergency hotline (999 in Malaysia) and communicate your location
- Parking the vehicle away from vegetation that would fuel the fire.
- Close all windows and vents in the vehicle. This keeps smoke out.
- Use a wool blanket or jacket to cover yourself in the car.
- Lay down on the vehicle floor.

If you become trapped on foot, the following procedures should be taken:

- Call emergency hotline (999 in Malaysia). Tell officials your location and situation.
- Find an area without vegetation. Look for ditches or ground depressions.
- Cover your body and lay face down on the ground.
